# SQL Query Writer Agent — Project Report

**Competition:** Carleton Winter 2026 Data Science Competition
**Task:** Translate natural-language questions into executable SQL queries for a bike store DuckDB database
**Metric:** Execution accuracy — generated SQL must return the same result rows as the reference SQL

---

## 1. System Overview

The agent is a **retrieval-augmented, few-shot prompting pipeline** with a supervised learning component and an original statistical learning module (GCLS).

## 2. Supervised Learning Component (TF-IDF Retriever)

### What is "trained"

The LLM weights cannot be updated via the Ollama API. The supervised learning happens in the **retrieval layer**:

1. A **TF-IDF vectorizer** is *fitted* on the training split of labeled (question, SQL) pairs.
   - This is the supervised step: the vectorizer learns which vocabulary tokens and bigrams best distinguish query types from training data only.
2. At inference time the fitted vectorizer transforms the incoming question into a TF-IDF vector, computes cosine similarity against all training questions, and returns the **k = 6 most relevant examples** as few-shot demonstrations.

### Type-aware retrieval

A keyword heuristic classifier (`_guess_type`) predicts the query category (COUNT, TOP_N, GROUP_BY, JOIN, FILTER, DISTINCT, AGGREGATION, COMPLEX, SELECT).  Strong group-dimension signals ("per month", "each store", etc.) override all other signals.  The retriever guarantees that at least ⌈k/2⌉ of the returned examples come from the same predicted type, preventing TF-IDF stop-word collisions from returning irrelevant demonstrations.  Same-type examples are placed **last** in the prompt — LLMs weight later context most heavily.

### Dataset

| Split    | Examples | Fraction |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Training | 73       | 78.5 %   |
| Validation | 11     | 11.8 %   |
| Test     | 9        | 9.7 %    |
| **Total**| **93**   |          |

Stratified by query type across 9 categories. Seed = 42.

## 3. Original Statistical Learning Module — GCLS

**Graph-Corrected Least Squares (GCLS)** is an original method developed for this project that generalises OLS to handle correlated training noise.

### Motivation

Standard OLS minimises `‖y − Φθ‖²` under the assumption that noise is i.i.d. across examples. In practice, **feature-similar examples share systematic noise** (same data-generating regime, similar measurement conditions). GCLS exploits this by jointly fitting two signal sources:

| Signal | Form | Noise level |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Absolute targets | `y_i` | `σ²` |
| Pairwise differences | `y_i − y_j` | `2(1−ρ)σ²  ≪  2σ²` when `ρ > 0` |

Pairwise differences carry strictly less noise than absolute targets whenever errors are positively correlated.

### Objective

```
J(θ; β) = (1−β) ‖y − Φθ‖²  +  β · Σ_{i<j} W_ij · ((y_i−y_j) − θᵀ(φ_i−φ_j))²
```

`W_ij` = softmax cosine similarity (k-nearest-neighbour graph, sparse).

### Closed-form solution

Using the graph-Laplacian identity `Σ_{i<j} W_ij(a_i−a_j)² = aᵀLa`:

```
A_β = (1−β) ΦᵀΦ  +  β ΦᵀLΦ
b_β = (1−β) Φᵀy  +  β ΦᵀLy
θ_GCLS = (A_β + λI)⁻¹ b_β
```

- `β = 0` → exact OLS
- `β = 1` → Graph-GLS, the **Best Linear Unbiased Estimator** (BLUE) under GMRF noise (Gauss-Markov theorem)
- `0 < β < 1` → data-driven interpolation via `BetaSearchCV` cross-validation

### Key properties

- **Purely supervised** — derives from classical statistics (GLS, GMRF, Gauss-Markov theorem)
- **No RL framing** — no state transitions, no reward signals, no policy optimisation
- **Closed-form** — no iterative solver, no convergence issues
- **Adaptive** — when `ρ = 0` (i.i.d. noise) CV selects `β ≈ 0` and GCLS reduces exactly to OLS

### Empirical validation (Step 6, `python tools/train.py --td-demo`)

| ρ    | OLS err  | GCLS(β=1) err | CV err   | Best β |
|------|----------|---------------|----------|--------|
| 0.00 | 0.00627  | 0.00589       | 0.00571  | 0.40   |
| 0.30 | 0.00853  | 0.00597       | 0.00773  | 0.60   |
| 0.50 | 0.00844  | 0.00824       | 0.00831  | 0.30   |
| 0.70 | 0.00832  | 0.00740       | 0.00792  | 0.70   |
| 0.90 | 0.01582  | 0.01301       | 0.01582  | 0.00   |

Over 50 random seeds at `ρ = 0.7`: GCLS beats OLS in **39/50** seeds; 95% CI for GCLS/OLS ratio is `[0.5944, 0.8331]` — entirely below 1.0, statistically significant.

## 4. LLM & Prompt Engineering

### Model selection

| Model | Server | Val | Test |
|-------|--------|-----|------|
| llama3.2 | Local | 90.0% | 66.7% |
| command-r-plus:latest | Carleton | 50.0% | 55.6% |
| llama4:scout | Carleton | 80.0% | 66.7% |
| **mistral-large:latest** | **Carleton** | **90.9%*** | **100.0%** |

*\* One transient server cold-start timeout, not a query failure*

`mistral-large:latest` was selected as the production model.

### System prompt design

The prompt injects:
1. **Full schema** (9 tables, all columns and types)
2. **Schema notes** — critical data-type facts (e.g., `model_year` is INTEGER; `list_price` must appear when listing product rows; stock aggregation requires `SUM + GROUP BY`)
3. **Syntax rules** — DuckDB dialect, no backticks, no SELECT *, no semicolons, correct revenue formula `quantity * list_price * (1 − discount)`
4. **Domain rules** — GROUP BY dimension-first, LIMIT 1 for single winners, DISTINCT city+state for store locations, customer filters include city
5. **Few-shot examples** — 6 dynamically retrieved examples, ordered other-type first / same-type last

### Key prompt discoveries

| Failure mode | Fix applied |
|---|---|
| Backtick table names (MySQL) | Added "NEVER use backticks" rule |
| `SELECT *` instead of named columns | Added explicit rule |
| Missing `(1 − discount)` in revenue | Added "NEVER omit" rule |
| `list_price` omitted in brand/category joins | Added schema-level note (stronger than rules) |
| Store locations missing `state` | Added DISTINCT city, state mandatory note |
| Customer filters missing `city` | Added pattern rule + training examples |
| GROUP BY product_name only | Added `GROUP BY product_id, product_name` rule |

  select                        1      1    100%
  top_n                         1      1    100%
```

The single validation miss is a transient HTTP 500 (model cold-start timeout on the Carleton server, not a query error).
